<h2>Code Institute Milestone Project 3 -
Command-line application using python.</h2>

<p>
    The aim of the third project was to build a command-line application using python, that takes in
    input from the user and processes it. This website is made for educational purposes only.

<p>This image is produced using the tool from <a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#" target="_blank">Am I Responsive</a></p>

<p>This website is created to provide students and teachers with educational resources that may help them for revision, class learning activities or even homework. It can be useful to any user who has an interest in learning about electronics and electrical circuits as a hobby. It provides them with a variety of quizzes, of different difficulties that cover a range of different topics.

<h1><strong>Technologies Used</strong></h1>
This project is based on HTML and CSS programming languages. Several technologies and tools were used to enable a functional design. These are listed below.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/" target="_blank">GitPod</a> - Was the development environment used to write the code and build the project. </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - Was the platform used to hose the code that was written and pushed from GitPod. </li>
<li><a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is/" target="_blank">Am I Responsive</a> - Was used to generate a repsonive image; displaying how the website would look on different devices. </li>

Gitpod I used this developer to write the code for this game.
Github Was used to host my repository and readme.
HerokuTo host my app and deploy here.
pep8online.com To validate my code and check for errors
</ul>

<h1><strong>Testing</strong></h1>


<h1><strong>Deployment</strong></h1>
This project was deployed using the code institute mock terminal along with Heroku. Throughout the project, 
the code was commited to git and pushed onto GitHub using git commands.
<br>
<h2>Deploy on to Heroku -</h2>
The following steps were carried out in order to deploy this project to Heroku from its GitHub repository:
<ol>
<li>On the Heroku dashboard, 'Create a new app' was selected. </li>
<li>The app name was entered, and the region was selected as Europe.</li>
<li>Once the app has been created, the setting tab was selected.</li>
<li>In the settings, the 'Buildpacks' were set by selected 'Python" first, followed by 'Node.js'.
<li>Scrolling down in the settings, a <em>Config Var</em> was added with the key set to <strong>PORT</strong> and the value is <strong>8000</strong></li>
<li>Next, the Deploy menu was selected, and GitHub was chosen as the "Deployment method"</li>
<li>'Connect too Github' was selected, and the repository name was searched and chosen. 'Connect' was then clicked to link the Github project repositry code to the Heroku app.</li>
<li>Scrolling down, 'Enable Automatic Deploys" was chosen, and the 'Deploy Branch' was selected.</li>
<li>After waiting a few moments for the app to build, a 'view app' button appeared which takes you to the deployed app</li>

</ol>
<h2>Clone the website -</h2>
This will clone your working repository onto a local version. This is useful to backup work and can be done by:
<ol>
<li>Selecting the repository from GitHub.</li>
<li>Clicking on the green <strong>'code'</strong> button.</li>
<li>Copy the URL link provided by the drop-down.</li>
<li>Next open GitPod and change the current working directory into the directory location you are wanting to create the clone in.</li>
<li>Type <strong>'git clone'</strong> in the terminal, and past the URL link from step 3. </li>
<li>Finally press enter and a local clone will be created at the selected location</li>
</ol>

<h1><strong>Credits</strong></h1>
<ul>
    <li>The idea behind this project was inspired by code insitute's example idea #2 from their project portfolio 3 module.</li>
